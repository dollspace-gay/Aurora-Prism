📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/direct-import.ts
   📈 Maintainability: 6/10 - The code is functional with good error handling and logging, but suffers from redundant processing loops and a lack of type safety, which significantly impacts its maintainability and scalability for larger datasets.
    - Line 71: [MEDIUM] The `repo.walkRecords()` iterator is called three separate times, leading to three full passes over all repository records. This is inefficient, especially for large repositories, as it re-reads and re-processes the same data multiple times.
      💡 Consolidate the record processing into a single loop. Use a `switch` statement on the `collection` property to handle different record types (users, posts, likes, reposts, follows, blocks) within that single pass. This improves efficiency by reducing iterations from 3*O(N) to O(N).
    - Line 71: [MEDIUM] The core logic of iterating through `repo.walkRecords()` is duplicated three times (lines 71, 98, 126). This leads to significant code duplication, making the code less modular, harder to read, and more challenging to maintain or extend.
      💡 Refactor the processing logic into a single loop, handling different collections within that loop, possibly using a `switch` statement or a dispatcher pattern. This aligns with the suggestion to improve performance by reducing iterations.
    - Line 31: [MEDIUM] The code frequently uses `(record as any)` and `s: any` to bypass TypeScript's type safety, particularly when accessing nested properties like `record.subject.uri` or `record.createdAt`. This removes compile-time checks and increases the risk of runtime errors (e.g., `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined`) if the actual data structure deviates from what's implicitly assumed, especially for data from an external PDS.
      💡 Define specific interfaces or types for the expected record structures (e.g., `AppBskyFeedPost.Record`, `AppBskyFeedLike.Record`) from the `@atproto/api` library or custom types. Use type guards (`isXRecord(record): record is XRecord`) to safely narrow the type of `record` within the `switch` cases, or explicitly cast to known types after checking the `collection`.
    - Line 76: [LOW] The `didResolver.handle.resolve(DID)` call is made inside the first processing loop. Since `DID` is a constant for the entire import operation, resolving its handle multiple times is redundant and inefficient.
      💡 Resolve the handle once at the beginning of the `importRepo` function and store the result in a variable. Then, reuse this pre-resolved handle wherever it's needed (e.g., in `storage.createUser`), avoiding unnecessary network calls.
    - Line 111: [LOW] Hardcoded numeric values like `100`, `500`, and `10` are used directly in the code for logging progress thresholds and error limits. These 'magic numbers' reduce readability and make it harder to consistently adjust these values if needed.
      💡 Define these numbers as named constants (e.g., `POST_LOG_THRESHOLD = 100`, `LIKE_LOG_THRESHOLD = 500`, `MAX_SKIPPED_ERROR_LOGS = 10`) at the top of the function or file. This improves code clarity and maintainability.
    - Line 80: [LOW] The `avatar_url` field in the `storage.createUser` call is always set to `null`. If the `app.bsky.actor.profile` record contains avatar information, it is currently ignored and not stored.
      💡 Inspect the `app.bsky.actor.profile` `record` object for properties that might contain avatar URLs (e.g., `record.avatar` or similar) and include them in the `createUser` call if present and valid. This would ensure more complete user profile data is imported.

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/import-car-batch.ts
   📈 Maintainability: 6/10 - The script is functional and uses robust external libraries and database practices, but its maintainability is hampered by a very long main function with significant code duplication.
    - Line 29: [MEDIUM] The `importCar` function is excessively long and performs numerous distinct operations including PDS resolution, CAR download, parsing, record classification, and multiple batch database insertions. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle, making the function hard to read, understand, test, and maintain.
      💡 Refactor `importCar` into smaller, more focused functions. For example, create dedicated functions like `resolvePdsEndpoint`, `downloadAndParseCar`, `classifyRecords`, `createUser`, and a generic `batchInsertRecords` helper.
    - Line 118: [MEDIUM] The batch insertion logic is largely duplicated across posts, likes, reposts, follows, and blocks. The pattern of slicing, mapping to values, and inserting into the database is repeated with only minor variations in the `map` function and the target table.
      💡 Create a generic `batchInsertRecords` helper function that takes the `records` array, the target Drizzle table, a `mapper` function (to transform record data into DB row values), and an optional `filter` function. This would significantly reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.

Example `batchInsertRecords` signature:
```typescript
async function batchInsertRecords<T>(
  recordType: string,
  records: { rkey: string; record: T; cid?: any }[],
  table: any,
  mapper: (item: { rkey: string; record: T; cid?: any }) => any,
  did: string,
  batchSize: number = BATCH_SIZE,
  filter?: (item: { rkey: string; record: T; cid?: any }) => boolean
): Promise<void> { /* ... */ }
```
    - Line 107: [LOW] The string 'Doll' is used as a default `displayName` without being defined as a constant. This is a magic string, making its purpose unclear without inspecting the code and harder to change if needed.
      💡 Define `DEFAULT_DISPLAY_NAME` as a constant at the top of the file (e.g., `const DEFAULT_DISPLAY_NAME = 'Doll';`) for clarity and easier modification.
    - Line 8: [LOW] The `extractBlobCid` function explicitly checks for the string literal `"undefined"`. This is an unusual pattern for handling missing or undefined values in JavaScript, which typically uses `typeof x === 'undefined'` or `x == null`. It suggests a specific upstream serialization behavior that might be brittle or a source of subtle bugs if the serialization changes.
      💡 Investigate the source of data that might be producing the string `"undefined"`. If this is an expected serialization format, add a comment explaining this specific data convention. If possible, it's generally better to normalize data earlier to standard `undefined` or `null` values.
    - Line 124: [LOW] The code uses `new Date(record.createdAt)` directly, assuming `record.createdAt` will always be a valid date string. If `record.createdAt` is missing or malformed, `new Date()` will return an 'Invalid Date' object. Depending on the Drizzle ORM and database configuration, this might either lead to `NULL` being inserted, a runtime error, or an unexpected date value.
      💡 Add explicit validation or a fallback for date parsing. For example, create a helper function that safely parses a date string and returns a `Date` object or `null` if the string is invalid or missing.

Example:
```typescript
const safeParseDate = (dateStr: string | undefined): Date | null => {
  if (!dateStr) return null;
  const date = new Date(dateStr);
  return isNaN(date.getTime()) ? null : date;
};
// Usage: createdAt: safeParseDate(record.createdAt) || new Date(), or simply safeParseDate(record.createdAt)
```

✅ /home/doll/PublicAppView/vite.config.ts: No issues found

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/fix-avatar-urls.ts
   📈 Maintainability: 8/10 - The code is well-structured, readable, and includes good error handling for a utility script, but has a potential performance bottleneck for large datasets and a minor type safety concern.
    - Line 48: [MEDIUM] The script fetches all user records and then iterates through them, performing a separate database UPDATE query for each user that requires a fix. For large datasets with many users needing updates, this 'N+1 update' pattern can lead to significant performance overhead due to repeated database round trips.
      💡 For very large datasets, consider optimizing the update process. One approach could be to collect all `did`s that need updates along with their new `avatarUrl` and `bannerUrl` values, and then perform a single bulk update using a `CASE` statement or a temporary table. This reduces the number of database round trips. Example for a single update with CASE (simplified): `await db.update(users).set({ avatarUrl: sql`CASE WHEN ${users.did} = 'did1' THEN 'newAvatar1' ... END`}).where(sql`${users.did} IN ('did1', 'did2', ...)`);` This might require more complex Drizzle constructs depending on the exact conditional logic.
    - Line 42: [LOW] Using `as any` bypasses TypeScript's type safety. While `profileRecord` is likely a JSONB column, asserting it as `any` means the compiler won't catch potential errors if `profileRecord`'s structure deviates from expectations (e.g., missing `avatar` or `banner` properties).
      💡 Define a specific interface or type for `profileRecord` that accurately reflects its expected JSON structure. This improves type safety and readability. For example: `interface ProfileRecord { avatar?: BlobRef; banner?: BlobRef; }` where `BlobRef` is also defined. Then, cast to this specific type: `const profileRecord = user.profileRecord as ProfileRecord;`

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/import-car.ts
   📈 Maintainability: 5/10 - The code is functional for its purpose, but its single large function, repetitive logic, and extensive use of 'any' types significantly hinder readability, testability, and scalability for a larger application.
    - Line 15: [LOW] The 'blob' parameter in 'extractBlobCid' function is typed as 'any', reducing type safety and making it harder to understand expected input format.
      💡 Define a more specific type or interface for 'blob' that reflects the expected structure (e.g., `string | { ref: string | { $link: string } } | { cid: string }`).
    - Line 39: [MEDIUM] The logic for `pdsService.serviceEndpoint.toString()` might lead to an invalid URL if `serviceEndpoint` is an object with a non-string representation or an array, as `toString()` on an object may not produce a valid URL string.
      💡 Explicitly check the type of `pdsService.serviceEndpoint` and handle potential array or complex object structures. For example, if it's an object with a 'url' property, use that: `pdsService.serviceEndpoint.url`.
    - Line 56: [MEDIUM] Accessing `roots[0]` without checking if the `roots` array is empty could lead to a runtime error if no roots are found in the CAR file.
      💡 Add a check to ensure `roots` array is not empty before accessing its first element: `if (roots.length === 0) { throw new Error('No roots found in CAR file'); }`.
    - Line 62: [MEDIUM] Extensive use of 'any[]' for the `records` arrays (profile, posts, likes, etc.) bypasses TypeScript's type checking, making it prone to errors related to record structure and properties.
      💡 Define specific interfaces for each record type (e.g., `ProfileRecord`, `PostRecord`) based on the AT Protocol schemas. This improves type safety, readability, and maintainability.
    - Line 62: [LOW] Collecting all records into in-memory arrays before processing them could lead to high memory consumption for very large CAR files, especially for `records.posts`.
      💡 Consider processing records in batches or directly inserting them into the database as they are yielded by `repo.walkRecords()`, if the processing order allows. For dependent records, a more sophisticated streaming or batching approach might be needed.
    - Line 91: [MEDIUM] The code assumes there is at most one profile record by accessing `records.profile[0]`. If a CAR file contains multiple profile records (e.g., old versions), only the first one will be used, and others will be ignored.
      💡 Add a comment explaining this assumption or include logic to handle multiple profiles (e.g., selecting the most recent one, or logging a warning if more than one is found).
    - Line 98: [MEDIUM] Storing the raw `profile` object (typed as `any`) directly into `profileRecord` in the database without explicit validation or sanitization could expose the system to malformed or excessively large data if the source CAR file is untrusted.
      💡 Define a clear schema for `profileRecord` in the database and validate/sanitize the incoming `profile` object to ensure it conforms to the expected structure and size limits before storage.
    - Line 130: [MEDIUM] The `onConflictDoNothing()` strategy for posts means that if a post with the same URI is imported again, it will not be updated. While this may be intended for immutable posts, it should be a conscious decision.
      💡 Add a comment explaining the immutability assumption for posts. If posts could ever be updated or contain new data (e.g., a new `cid` for the same `uri`), `onConflictDoUpdate` might be more appropriate, or a specific handling for versioning.
    - Line 139: [LOW] Generic `catch (error: any)` blocks are used without specific error handling. This can mask underlying issues and makes it difficult to distinguish between transient and permanent errors.
      💡 Refine error handling to catch specific types of errors (e.g., database constraint errors, network errors) and react accordingly. Consider using a more robust logging framework and potentially implementing retry logic for transient issues.
    - Line 134: [LOW] Frequent `console.log` calls inside a loop (`postsCreated % 500 === 0`) can introduce I/O overhead, especially for very large numbers of records. While useful for progress, it could be a bottleneck.
      💡 Adjust logging frequency for progress updates based on expected data scale (e.g., every 1000 or 5000 records) or use a more performant logging solution that buffers outputs.
    - Line 154: [MEDIUM] The `postUri` is defaulted to an empty string `''` if `(record as any).subject?.uri` is missing or malformed. An empty string is often not a valid URI and could lead to database constraint violations or corrupted data.
      💡 Validate the `postUri` to ensure it's a valid URI. If it's invalid, either throw an error and skip the record, or default to `null` if the database schema allows for nullable URIs, ensuring data integrity.
    - Line 204: [MEDIUM] The `followingDid` is defaulted to an empty string `''` if `(record as any).subject` is missing or malformed. An empty string is not a valid DID and could lead to database constraint violations or corrupted data.
      💡 Validate the `followingDid` to ensure it's a valid DID. If it's invalid, either throw an error and skip the record, or default to `null` if the database schema allows for nullable DIDs, ensuring data integrity.
    - Line 236: [MEDIUM] The `importCar` function is excessively long (over 200 lines) and has a high cyclomatic complexity, making it difficult to read, understand, test, and maintain. It performs multiple distinct high-level operations.
      💡 Refactor the `importCar` function into smaller, more focused functions. For example, separate steps like 'resolve DID and fetch CAR', 'parse CAR and collect records', 'create user', 'create posts', 'create interactions' into their own functions.
    - Line 134: [LOW] Magic numbers (`500`, `1000`, `200`, `10`) are used for logging frequency and error limits without clear explanation or definition as constants.
      💡 Define these numbers as named constants (e.g., `POST_LOG_INTERVAL`, `MAX_ERROR_LOGS`) at the top of the file to improve readability and make them easier to modify.
    - Line 149: [LOW] Repetitive error handling and database insertion logic is duplicated across likes, reposts, follows, and blocks. This violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
      💡 Extract the common insertion and error handling logic into a generic helper function that takes the Drizzle schema, records array, URI builder, and value mapping function as arguments. This will reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.
    - Line 124: [MEDIUM] Frequent casting to `any` (e.g., `(record as any).text`) indicates a lack of proper type definitions for the record objects, undermining TypeScript's benefits.
      💡 Define TypeScript interfaces for each AT Protocol record type (e.g., `AppBskyFeedPost`, `AppBskyFeedLike`) based on the protocol schemas. This will provide compile-time type safety and better developer experience.
    - Line 10: [LOW] The `DID` is hardcoded in the script. This limits its reusability and requires code modification to import data for a different DID.
      💡 Make the `DID` configurable, for example, by passing it as a command-line argument: `process.argv[2]`, or reading it from an environment variable.

✅ /home/doll/PublicAppView/drizzle.config.ts: No issues found

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/create-oauth-keyset.ts
   📈 Maintainability: 7/10 - The code is simple and easy to understand but lacks essential error handling and secure file permission management for sensitive data.
    - Line 9: [HIGH] The `oauth-keyset.json` file, which contains a private key, is written with default file permissions. By default, `writeFileSync` creates files with `0o666` permissions (read/write for all), making the private key globally accessible on the system. This is a critical security vulnerability.
      💡 Explicitly set restrictive file permissions (e.g., `0o600` for owner-only read/write) using the `mode` option in `writeFileSync` to protect the private key. Ensure the user running the script has appropriate umask set as well, but `mode` is more explicit.
    - Line 4: [MEDIUM] The script lacks error handling for file system operations (`readFileSync`, `writeFileSync`). If the input file (`oauth-private-key.pem`) does not exist, is unreadable, or if the output file cannot be written due to permissions or other issues, the script will crash abruptly without a graceful exit or informative message.
      💡 Wrap file operations in `try...catch` blocks to gracefully handle potential errors (e.g., `ENOENT` for file not found, `EACCES` for permission denied), provide informative messages to the user, and exit with a non-zero status code on failure.
    - Line 4: [LOW] Key filenames (`oauth-private-key.pem`, `oauth-keyset.json`) and the `kid` value (`appview-oauth-key`) are hardcoded directly in the script. While acceptable for a simple utility, this reduces flexibility and reusability if different file names or key IDs are needed without modifying the code.
      💡 Consider making these values configurable, for example, by accepting them as command-line arguments, environment variables, or from a configuration file, to improve the script's flexibility and reusability.

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/run-migration.js
   📈 Maintainability: 8/10: The code is simple, readable, and generally follows good practices for a utility script, though it has one unused import and a minor information disclosure risk via console logs.
    - Line 34: [MEDIUM] The script prints the full `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the console. This URL often contains sensitive credentials (e.g., username, password). If the console output is logged or visible in insecure environments (e.g., CI/CD logs accessible to unauthorized users), it could lead to sensitive information disclosure.
      💡 Avoid printing the full `DATABASE_URL` to the console. If the URL is needed for manual instructions, consider masking sensitive parts or advising users to retrieve it securely. For example, instead of `psql "${process.env.DATABASE_URL}"`, you might suggest `psql "$DB_URL"` and instruct the user to set `$DB_URL` in their shell. If this script were to execute the command directly, proper environment variable handling for sensitive data would be crucial (e.g., not logging it).
    - Line 7: [LOW] The `exec` function from the `child_process` module is imported but never used within the script. This indicates dead code.
      💡 Remove the unused `exec` import to keep the codebase clean. If `exec` was intended for future functionality, consider removing the import until that functionality is implemented.

```javascript
// Remove this line:
// const { exec } = require('child_process');
```
    - Line 1: [LOW] The script is named 'run-migration.js' and described as a 'Database Migration Runner', yet it only provides instructions for manual execution rather than performing the migration itself. This can be misleading and might not meet user expectations for an automated 'runner'. While this might be a conscious security decision to prevent automatic execution, the naming could be clearer.
      💡 If the intention is strictly to provide manual instructions, consider renaming the script (e.g., `show-migration-instructions.js` or `prepare-migration.js`) to better reflect its actual functionality. If automation is desired, implement the `exec` or `spawn` call (with extreme caution regarding security, e.g., using `spawn` with an array of arguments for `psql` and ensuring `DATABASE_URL` and `MIGRATION_FILE` are properly handled to prevent shell injection).

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/check-avatar-db.ts
   📈 Maintainability: 7/10 - The script is clear, well-commented for its purpose, and easy to understand, but has a minor resource management issue and a hardcoded value that limits reusability.
    - Line 56: [MEDIUM] The database connection pool is not guaranteed to be closed in all error scenarios.
      💡 To ensure the `pool.end()` method is always called, even if an error occurs during `checkAvatars()` execution, wrap the `checkAvatars()` call in a try-finally block. This prevents potential resource leaks.

```typescript
async function main() {
  const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
  const db = drizzle(pool);
  try {
    await checkAvatars(db);
  } finally {
    await pool.end();
  }
}

// Modify checkAvatars to accept db instance:
async function checkAvatars(db: ReturnType<typeof drizzle>) {
  // ... rest of your function ...
  // Remove `await pool.end()` from inside this function
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('Error:', err);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```
    - Line 26: [LOW] The 'did' value for querying the database is hardcoded.
      💡 While acceptable for a quick script, if this script were to be generalized or reused, the 'did' should be configurable. Consider passing it as a command-line argument, an environment variable, or reading it from a configuration file.

Example (command-line argument):
```typescript
const targetDid = process.argv[2] || 'did:plc:dzvxvsiy3maw4iarpvizsj67'; // Fallback to current hardcoded
// ...
// WHERE did = ${sql.placeholder('targetDid')}
// .execute(sql`...`, { targetDid });
```

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/import-car-no-fk.ts
   📈 Maintainability: 6/10 - The code features robust error handling and efficient batch processing, but suffers from a lack of type safety, significant duplicated logic, and some hardcoded values which hinder long-term maintainability and potential reuse.
    - Line 79: [LOW] The `BATCH_SIZE` of 500 is a magic number. It's used multiple times throughout the batch insertion loops.
      💡 Declare `BATCH_SIZE` as a named constant at the top of the file or in a configuration object to improve readability and maintainability. For example: `const BATCH_SIZE = 500;`.
    - Line 35: [MEDIUM] Extensive use of the `any` type (e.g., `records: any[]`, `record as any`) bypasses TypeScript's type safety. This makes it harder to catch potential errors at compile time and reduces code clarity regarding expected data structures and properties.
      💡 Define specific interfaces or types for the `item` structure and the various `record` types (e.g., `AppBskyFeedPost`, `AppBskyFeedLike` from `@atproto/api` or custom schemas). This will enforce type checking and improve code robustness. For example, `records: { collection: string; rkey: string; record: SomeDefinedRecordType; cid: CID | undefined }[]`.
    - Line 95: [MEDIUM] Date creation using `new Date((record as any).createdAt)` can result in an 'Invalid Date' object if `createdAt` is missing, `undefined`, or not a valid date string. Passing an invalid date to the database could lead to insertion failures or unexpected `null` values without explicit handling.
      💡 Add validation to ensure `createdAt` is a valid date string before creating the `Date` object. If invalid, explicitly set the value to `null` or handle the error. For example:
```typescript
const createdAts = batch.map(({ record }) => {
  const createdAtStr = (record as any).createdAt;
  return createdAtStr && !isNaN(new Date(createdAtStr).getTime())
    ? new Date(createdAtStr)
    : null; // Or throw an error, or use a default date
});
// Adjust SQL to handle potentially null timestamps if necessary
```
    - Line 81: [MEDIUM] The batch insertion logic, including the loop structure, slicing, mapping record properties, and `db.execute` call with `unnest`, is duplicated across multiple record types (posts, likes, reposts, follows, blocks). This violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and makes maintenance more difficult.
      💡 Refactor the batch insertion into a generic function that accepts the target table name, the array of records, the author DID, and a callback function to map each record to its specific database fields. This improves code reusability and maintainability.
    - Line 29: [LOW] The type assertion `response.data as Uint8Array` assumes the response data is always of this type. If the API contract changes or an unexpected data type is received, this could lead to runtime errors when `readCar` is called with incorrect input, as TypeScript's type assertion is only compile-time.
      💡 Add a runtime type check or type guard to verify that `response.data` is an instance of `Uint8Array` before proceeding. For example:
```typescript
const carBytes = response.data;
if (!(carBytes instanceof Uint8Array)) {
  throw new Error('Expected CAR data to be Uint8Array, but received ' + typeof carBytes);
}
// ... then use carBytes
```
    - Line 7: [LOW] The `DID` is hardcoded directly in the script. While acceptable for a specific one-off task, for increased flexibility or potential reuse with different DIDs, it's better to make this value configurable.
      💡 Consider passing the `DID` as a command-line argument, an environment variable, or loading it from a configuration file. This allows the script to be more easily adapted to different contexts without modifying the source code.
    - Line 61: [LOW] Temporarily disabling foreign key constraints using `SET session_replication_role = replica;` can improve bulk import performance. While the `finally` block correctly re-enables them, a catastrophic process crash or an unhandled synchronous error *before* the `try` block is entered (though unlikely in this specific structure) could potentially leave FKs disabled.
      💡 For a single-user script, this approach is common and acceptable. In a multi-user or critical production system where such a state could have broader impact, consider more robust transaction management or alternative bulk data loading strategies to ensure FKs are consistently managed. For this script, the `try...finally` block is generally sufficient.

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/test-did-resolver-cache.ts
   📈 Maintainability: 8/10. The code is generally well-structured, clear, and effectively demonstrates its purpose. The identified issues are minor code smells related to duplication and magic numbers, which are common in test scripts but could be slightly improved for better long-term maintainability.
    - Line 20: [LOW] Duplication of code for logging cache statistics. The pattern 'console.log(JSON.stringify(didResolver.getCacheStats(), null, 2));' is repeated multiple times in 'testCaching' and 'testConcurrency'.
      💡 Extract the cache stats logging into a reusable helper function to avoid repetition and improve readability. For example:
```typescript
function logCacheStats(resolver: typeof didResolver, prefix: string = '') {
  console.log(`${prefix}Cache stats:\n${JSON.stringify(resolver.getCacheStats(), null, 2)}\n`);
}
// Usage:
logCacheStats(didResolver, 'Initial status:');
```
    - Line 25: [LOW] Duplication of the DID resolution and logging loop. The same block of code to resolve DIDs and measure/log performance is repeated for the 'First Resolution' and 'Second Resolution' passes within 'testCaching'.
      💡 Extract this common resolution logic into a private helper function. This will make the 'testCaching' function shorter and more focused on orchestrating the test phases. For example:
```typescript
async function resolveAndLogDIDs(dids: string[], title: string) {
  console.log(`=== ${title} ===`);
  const startTime = Date.now();
  for (const did of dids) {
    const start = Date.now();
    const handle = await didResolver.resolveDIDToHandle(did);
    const duration = Date.now() - start;
    console.log(`✓ ${did} → ${handle} (${duration}ms)`);
  }
  const totalTime = Date.now() - startTime;
  console.log(`\nTotal time: ${totalTime}ms`);
  return totalTime;
}
// Usage in testCaching:
const totalTime1 = await resolveAndLogDIDs(testDIDs, 'First Resolution (Cache Miss)');
```
    - Line 82: [LOW] Magic number '50' is used directly for the number of concurrent requests in 'testConcurrency'. While clear in this specific context, defining it as a named constant can improve clarity and maintainability if this value needs to be changed or understood elsewhere.
      💡 Define the number of concurrent requests as a named constant at the beginning of the 'testConcurrency' function. For example:
```typescript
const CONCURRENT_REQUEST_COUNT = 50;
// ...
const requests = Array(CONCURRENT_REQUEST_COUNT).fill(0).map((_, i) =>
  testDIDs[i % testDIDs.length]
);
```

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/inspect-car.ts
   📈 Maintainability: 8/10 - The code is well-structured for a script, uses modern TypeScript features, and has good error handling, with minor areas for improvement in constants, types, and large-scale performance considerations.
    - Line 7: [LOW] The `DID` is hardcoded directly in the script.
      💡 For better reusability and flexibility, consider passing the DID as a command-line argument or environment variable, or loading it from a configuration file.
    - Line 11: [LOW] The `s: any` type annotation in the `find` callback reduces type safety.
      💡 Define a more specific interface or type for `s` (e.g., `ServiceEndpoint`) based on the expected structure of `didDoc.service` to leverage TypeScript's benefits.
    - Line 12: [LOW] Magic strings (`'#atproto_pds'`, `'AtprotoPersonalDataServer'`) are used to identify the PDS service.
      💡 Define these as named constants (e.g., `ATPROTO_PDS_ID`, `ATPROTO_PDS_TYPE`) to improve readability and maintainability.
    - Line 26: [MEDIUM] The script loads the entire CAR file into memory (`carBytes`) and then constructs an in-memory `MemoryBlockstore` from all blocks. For extremely large repositories, this could lead to significant memory consumption and potential out-of-memory errors.
      💡 For very large repositories, consider if streaming processing or a disk-backed blockstore (if the `@atproto/repo` library supports it) could be used to reduce peak memory footprint. For typical ATProto repositories, this approach is often acceptable, but it's a known scaling limitation.
    - Line 38: [LOW] Records are stringified using `JSON.stringify(record, null, 2)` inside the loop when collecting samples. While only two samples are kept per collection, repeated stringification adds unnecessary processing time and memory overhead for the stored samples, especially if records are complex or there are many collections.
      💡 Store the raw `record` object in `sampleRecords` and perform `JSON.stringify` only once during the final output phase to improve efficiency and reduce memory usage.

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/manual-import.ts
   📈 Maintainability: 8/10: The code is generally well-structured, follows a clear logical flow, and includes robust error handling for external API interactions. Minor improvements in typing, the use of named constants, and explicit handling of external component security assumptions would further enhance its maintainability and robustness.
    - Line 15: [LOW] Magic number '2' for the database pool size and magic string 'manual-import' for the pool name. While descriptive, these values could be made configurable or constants for better clarity and flexibility.
      💡 Define these values as named constants or pass them as parameters from a configuration object. For example: `const DB_POOL_SIZE = 2; const DB_POOL_NAME = 'manual-import';`
    - Line 18: [LOW] Loose typing with `record: any` in the `generateSyntheticCid` function signature, and implicitly throughout the record processing (e.g., when passing to `removeNullBytesFromObject` and `eventProcessor.processCommit`). While TypeScript's 'any' type is sometimes necessary, it bypasses type checking and can hide potential bugs or make refactoring difficult.
      💡 Define a more specific interface or type for `record` if possible (e.g., `AppBskyRecord` or `Record<string, unknown>`) to leverage TypeScript's type safety features and improve code clarity and maintainability.
    - Line 20: [LOW] Magic number '50' is used for substring length when generating a synthetic CID. This number lacks explicit meaning and makes the code harder to understand or modify without additional context.
      💡 Extract the magic number into a named constant to improve readability and maintainability. For example: `const SYNTHETIC_CID_TRUNCATION_LENGTH = 50;`.
    - Line 20: [LOW] Truncating a base64 string to 50 characters for a 'synthetic CID' might lead to collisions, especially for different inputs that produce the same first 50 characters after base64 encoding. While labeled 'synthetic', callers might implicitly expect a high degree of uniqueness. This is a design trade-off that should be clearly understood.
      💡 If strict uniqueness is critical for synthetic CIDs (even in a fallback scenario), consider using a cryptographically strong hash (e.g., SHA256) and encoding its full output, or generating a UUID, instead of a truncated base64 string. If collisions are acceptable given the fallback nature, document this assumption clearly in a comment.
    - Line 95: [LOW] The `eventProcessor.processCommit` function processes the `sanitized` record data (which originates from user-generated content). It is assumed that the `eventProcessor` internally handles this data securely, particularly by using parameterized queries or an ORM that prevents SQL injection, and properly sanitizes for XSS if outputting to a web context. `removeNullBytesFromObject` is a good first step, but not a full injection safeguard.
      💡 Ensure the `eventProcessor.processCommit` implementation, and any downstream data storage or rendering logic, uses prepared statements/ORMs to prevent SQL injection and proper output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities, especially since `record` can contain arbitrary JSON content.
    - Line 99: [LOW] Magic number '100' is used to determine the frequency of progress logging. This number lacks explicit meaning and could be made a named constant.
      💡 Extract the magic number into a named constant to improve readability and maintainability. For example: `const LOG_PROGRESS_INTERVAL = 100;`.
    - Line 105: [MEDIUM] A magic string `'23505'` is used to identify a specific PostgreSQL duplicate key error code. Relying on a hardcoded, database-specific error string makes the code brittle and less portable, as the error reporting mechanism could change in future database or driver versions.
      💡 If the database client library provides specific error constants or typed error objects for common database errors (like unique constraint violations), use those instead. Otherwise, encapsulate this check within a clearly named constant or a helper function that documents its purpose and source to centralize its usage and make it easier to update.

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/test-client/at-protocol-client.ts
   📈 Maintainability: 8/10 - The code is well-structured, uses async/await effectively, and includes good error handling and logging. Minor code smells like magic numbers and repetitive logging patterns are present but do not significantly hinder maintainability.
    - Line 43: [LOW] Magic number '10' used for limiting JSON stringification output. While functional, using a named constant improves readability and makes the intent clearer.
      💡 Define a constant for the maximum number of lines to display, e.g., `const MAX_LOG_DATA_LINES = 10;`.
    - Line 52: [LOW] Magic number '5' used for the `limit` parameter in `searchActors`. This value is hardcoded without explanation.
      💡 Consider defining a named constant for search limits, e.g., `const ACTOR_SEARCH_LIMIT = 5;`.
    - Line 138: [LOW] Usage of `as any` to bypass TypeScript's type checking for `firstPost.post.record`. While often necessary for external library types, it reduces type safety and can hide potential bugs if the API response structure changes.
      💡 If possible, define more specific types for `firstPost.post.record` or extend the `BskyAgent`'s type definitions if this is a common pattern to avoid `as any`.
    - Line 138: [LOW] Magic number '100' used for `substring` length. This arbitrary number limits the output without a clear rationale.
      💡 Extract '100' into a named constant, e.g., `const MAX_POST_TEXT_PREVIEW_LENGTH = 100;`.
    - Line 178: [LOW] Usage of `as any` to bypass TypeScript's type checking for `firstPost.post.record`. While often necessary for external library types, it reduces type safety.
      💡 If possible, define more specific types for `firstPost.post.record` or extend the `BskyAgent`'s type definitions if this is a common pattern to avoid `as any`.
    - Line 178: [LOW] Magic number '50' used for `substring` length. This arbitrary number limits the output without a clear rationale.
      💡 Extract '50' into a named constant, e.g., `const MAX_AUTHOR_FEED_TEXT_PREVIEW_LENGTH = 50;`.
    - Line 202: [LOW] The console logging for summary headers uses string repetition (`"=".repeat(60)` and `"-".repeat(60)`) with a magic number '60'.
      💡 Define a constant for the line length, e.g., `const SUMMARY_LINE_LENGTH = 60;`.
    - Line 32: [LOW] Repeated use of ANSI escape codes (`\x1b[32m`, `\x1b[31m`, `\x1b[0m`) for console output coloring. While functional, abstracting these into named constants or helper functions would improve readability and maintainability.
      💡 Define color constants like `const GREEN = '\x1b[32m';` and `const RESET = '\x1b[0m';`.
    - Line 49: [LOW] Repetitive logging pattern for test results (success/failure) across multiple test methods. Each `test*` method manually constructs the `TestResult` object and calls `this.logResult` multiple times for different aspects of the test.
      💡 Consider creating a helper function within `AppViewTester` or a separate utility to encapsulate the common pattern of calling an API, checking its response, and then logging success/failure for specific assertions. This could reduce boilerplate and improve consistency.

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/server/vite.ts
   📈 Maintainability: 7/10 - The code is generally well-structured with good security practices like explicit sanitization, but could benefit from minor refactoring and externalizing configuration for improved flexibility and readability.
    - Line 81: [MEDIUM] The Content-Security-Policy (CSP) includes 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' directives. While often necessary for modern JavaScript framework development servers (e.g., Vite HMR), these significantly weaken the CSP's protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by allowing inline scripts and eval-like functions.
      💡 For production deployments, remove or replace 'unsafe-inline' and 'unsafe-eval' with stricter alternatives like nonces or hashes. For development, ensure that the scope of untrusted content is minimal. Consider making the CSP configurable based on the environment.
    - Line 24: [LOW] The Vite server configuration uses `allowedHosts: true`. This setting is highly permissive, allowing the development server to be accessed from any host. In a production or less controlled environment, this could expose the server to DNS rebinding attacks or unintended public access.
      💡 Specify a strict list of allowed hosts (e.g., `['localhost', '127.0.0.1']`) or specific IP addresses instead of `true` to limit access and enhance security, especially if the server is not strictly for local development.
    - Line 39: [LOW] The anonymous middleware function for handling HTML transformation is quite long and encompasses multiple responsibilities including file I/O, URL parsing, HTML transformation, sanitization, and setting security headers. This reduces readability and makes the function harder to test and maintain.
      💡 Refactor the middleware logic into smaller, more focused utility functions. For example, create separate functions for reading the template, sanitizing the URL path, transforming HTML, and setting security headers.
    - Line 81: [LOW] The Content-Security-Policy string is hardcoded directly within the `setupVite` function. This reduces flexibility and makes it harder to manage, especially if different policies are needed for different environments (e.g., a stricter CSP for production vs. development).
      💡 Extract the CSP string into a configuration constant or a dedicated configuration file. This allows for easier modification and environment-specific adjustments.
    - Line 49: [LOW] The string `src="/src/main.tsx"` is hardcoded for cache busting within the HTML template replacement. If the main entry point path of the Vite application changes, this string would need to be manually updated, potentially leading to errors or outdated cache busting.
      💡 Consider making this path configurable or derive it dynamically from Vite's configuration if possible, rather than hardcoding it directly within the template manipulation logic.

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/server/storage.ts
   📈 Maintainability: 6/10 - The codebase demonstrates good use of Drizzle ORM and includes some effective caching strategies, but suffers from a significant architectural flaw in database connection management, alongside repetitive code patterns and some data integrity race conditions.
    - Line 1011: [HIGH] The `DatabaseStorage` class's constructor is designed to accept an optional `dbConnection` for dependency injection (e.g., for testing or specific transaction contexts). However, many methods within the class directly reference the globally imported `db` instance instead of `this.db`. This bypasses the injected connection, making the class difficult to test with mock connections and potentially leading to unintended behavior in multi-database or transactional scenarios.
      💡 Replace all direct uses of the globally imported `db` with `this.db` throughout the `DatabaseStorage` class to ensure consistent use of the connection established in the constructor. For example, change `await db.update(users)` to `await this.db.update(users)`.
    - Line 1059: [MEDIUM] In `createUser` and `upsertUserHandle`, the Redis user counter (`redisQueue.incrementRecordCount`) is incremented based on a pre-check (`this.getUser`) to determine if the user is new. In a concurrent environment, two requests could both perform `this.getUser` and find no existing user, both then proceed to `onConflictDoUpdate` (where one inserts, one updates) and both subsequently increment the Redis counter. This leads to an over-incremented and inaccurate user count in Redis.
      💡 To prevent race conditions for counters, the increment should ideally be tied atomically to the database operation or triggered by a database event that definitively indicates a new record insert. If Drizzle ORM provides a way to differentiate between `INSERT` and `UPDATE` on `onConflictDoUpdate` (e.g., checking affected rows or returning specific data), use that to conditionally increment. Otherwise, consider an event-driven pattern where actual database inserts trigger a single, atomic counter update.
    - Line 2049: [MEDIUM] The `getListFeed` method first fetches up to 500 list items and then uses their `subjectDid`s in an `inArray` clause to fetch posts. This results in two separate database queries and might not be efficient for large lists. The hardcoded limit of 500 for `listItems` also means that a feed for a list with more than 500 members will be incomplete.
      💡 Refactor `getListFeed` to perform a single `JOIN` operation between the `posts` and `listItems` tables. This allows the database to handle the filtering, ordering, and limiting more efficiently, leveraging indexes and avoiding unnecessary data transfer and processing in the application layer. This also removes the artificial 500-member cap.
    - Line 1419: [LOW] The pattern for handling cursor-based pagination (fetching `limit + 1` records, slicing, and determining `nextCursor`) is repeated identically across more than a dozen methods in the `DatabaseStorage` class. This leads to code duplication and makes maintenance or changes to the pagination logic more cumbersome.
      💡 Extract the common pagination logic into a reusable helper function or a protected method that can be called by all relevant paginated query methods. This would improve code readability, reduce duplication, and centralize pagination concerns.
    - Line 1058: [LOW] The import of `redisQueue` and the subsequent call to `redisQueue.incrementRecordCount` is duplicated in numerous `create` and `delete` methods for various entities. This creates boilerplate code and tightly couples each data operation to the Redis counter update logic.
      💡 Consider abstracting the Redis counter updates. This could be done by creating a generic helper method that accepts the entity type and the delta, or by implementing an event system where database mutations emit events that a central listener processes to update Redis counters.
    - Line 1045: [LOW] The `profileRecord` field is stored and retrieved as `any` and is passed through `sanitizeObject`. While `sanitizeObject` is used, the `any` type implies that arbitrary JSON structures can be stored. If a frontend or other service were to render this `profileRecord` directly without additional context-specific escaping or validation, it could potentially lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the `sanitizeObject` function does not comprehensively handle all possible attack vectors for dynamic JSON content.
      💡 If the structure of `profileRecord` is known or constrained, define a more specific TypeScript type for it to enforce structure and improve safety. Ensure the `sanitizeObject` function is rigorously tested against various XSS payloads for JSON data and that client-side rendering always performs context-appropriate escaping for `profileRecord` content.
    - Line 1729: [LOW] The `getTimeline` method includes a special code path for users who are not following anyone (`followingDids.length === 0`), where it fetches 'all posts'. While potentially a desired feature for new users, it adds branching complexity and might not scale if the 'all posts' query becomes very large. The default limit of `getFollows` (100) means `followingDids` will never be excessively large, but the separate logic path remains.
      💡 Clarify and document the intent behind showing 'all posts' for users with no follows. If this is a deliberate onboarding feature, consider if a more explicit 'discover' feed would be better. For the current implementation, the conditional `where(conditions.length > 0 ? and(...conditions) : undefined)` for the 'all posts' path is correctly handled by Drizzle, so this is mainly a code clarity and design consideration rather than a bug.

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/server/routes.ts
   📈 Maintainability: 7/10 - The code demonstrates strong use of TypeScript and Zod for validation and clear security intentions (CSRF, SSRF), but suffers from an extremely long main function and significant code duplication, hindering maintainability and ease of navigation.
    - Line 28: [HIGH] The `registerRoutes` function is excessively long (1000+ lines) and has too many responsibilities, violating the Single Responsibility Principle. It handles service initialization, Redis consumer setup, WebSocket servers, and all API/XRPC route registrations.
      💡 Refactor `registerRoutes` into smaller, more focused functions or modules. For example, create separate functions like `initializeCoreServices(app)`, `setupRedisConsumers()`, `registerApiEndpoints(app)`, `registerXrpcEndpoints(app)`, `setupWebsockets(httpServer)`. This will improve readability, maintainability, and testability.
    - Line 482: [MEDIUM] Multiple API endpoints redundantly fetch the user session from storage using `storage.getSession(req.session!.sessionId)` within a single request. This leads to unnecessary database calls, impacting performance for authenticated routes.
      💡 Implement a middleware to fetch the full session object once per authenticated request and attach it to the `req` object (e.g., `req.fullSession`). This middleware should run after `requireAuth` to ensure `req.session.sessionId` is available. All subsequent route handlers can then access the pre-fetched session details without additional database queries.
    - Line 771: [MEDIUM] Many API endpoints for user settings (e.g., blocking keywords, muting users) contain highly repetitive logic for fetching existing settings, creating default settings if none exist, and then updating them. This leads to code duplication.
      💡 Create a reusable utility function or middleware to abstract the common pattern of retrieving user settings and ensuring defaults. This function could return the settings object, creating it if necessary, and then allow the route handler to apply specific updates.
    - Line 643: [MEDIUM] The `app.delete('/api/likes/:uri')` and `app.delete('/api/follows/:uri')` endpoints delete records based on a URI extracted from `req.params.uri`. While `pdsClient.deleteRecord` receives `session.userDid` and presumably enforces ownership on the PDS, the local `storage.deleteLike(uri)` and `storage.deleteFollow(uri)` methods might not explicitly verify that the `userDid` from the authenticated session is the legitimate owner of the record in local storage. This could lead to Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) if the local storage layer does not enforce authorization and allows any authenticated user to delete any record by URI.
      💡 Ensure `storage.deleteLike(uri)` and `storage.deleteFollow(uri)` methods explicitly include `userDid` (from `req.session.userDid`) in their database queries to verify ownership before deleting the record. For example, `await storage.deleteLike(uri, session.userDid);` and update the `storage` implementation to check for `WHERE uri = ? AND userDid = ?`.
    - Line 1335: [LOW] The `/api/endpoints` route iterates through `app._router.stack` on every request to discover XRPC routes and their methods. While this route is likely for administrative or monitoring purposes, performing this operation repeatedly can be inefficient, especially for applications with many routes or if accessed frequently.
      💡 Cache the discovered XRPC routes and their methods. Perform the `app._router.stack` introspection only once during application startup or the first time the endpoint is accessed, and then serve the cached result for subsequent requests. Implement a mechanism to invalidate and re-cache if routes can change dynamically at runtime (unlikely for Express routes).
    - Line 395: [LOW] The fallback for streaming blob responses for environments without Web Streams support (`response.body && typeof response.body.tee === 'function'`) uses `Buffer.from(await response.arrayBuffer())`. For very large blobs, loading the entire content into memory via `arrayBuffer()` before sending can lead to high memory consumption and potential Out-Of-Memory (OOM) errors, especially under heavy load. While the primary path uses streaming, this fallback is less robust.
      💡 Consider alternatives for environments without Web Streams, such as polyfills or a more memory-efficient streaming library. If a pure streaming fallback is not feasible, implement a maximum size limit for blobs handled by the `arrayBuffer()` fallback to prevent OOM errors, returning an error for excessively large blobs.
    - Line 482: [LOW] The `any` type is used in several Zod schemas, such as `customLists: z.array(z.any())` and `feedPreferences: z.record(z.any())`. While flexible, this weakens type safety and makes it harder to validate the actual structure of these complex objects at runtime, potentially allowing malformed data to be stored or processed.
      💡 Define more specific Zod schemas for `customLists`, `feedPreferences`, `localizedStrings`, and any other `any` type usage where the data structure is known or can be constrained. This will enforce stricter validation and improve overall type safety.
    - Line 204: [LOW] The error response format is inconsistent across the application. While most API endpoints return JSON objects with an `error` field, the `/img` blob proxy endpoint and the `serveDIDDocument` fallback return `type('text/plain').send(...)`. Consistent error responses (e.g., always JSON) make API consumption easier and more predictable for clients.
      💡 Standardize error responses to always return a JSON object, even for image or file-related endpoints. For example, `res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error', message: errorMessage });` This ensures a consistent API contract for error handling.
    - Line 560: [LOW] The rollback logic implemented in `createPost`, `createLike`, and `createFollow` endpoints is highly repetitive. The pattern of attempting local storage, catching an error, and then attempting to delete the record from PDS is almost identical across these handlers.
      💡 Extract the rollback logic into a reusable utility function or a higher-order function that can wrap the `storage.create` calls. This would reduce code duplication and centralize the rollback mechanism.

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/server/db.ts
   📈 Maintainability: 7/10 - The code is generally well-structured and commented, but it contains a critical bug related to connection pool sizing and several code smells that reduce maintainability and type safety.
    - Line 85: [HIGH] The `parseInt` function for `DB_POOL_SIZE` can return `NaN` if the environment variable is not a valid number. Passing `NaN` as the `max` connections to the database pool constructors (`NeonPool` or `PgPool`) will effectively set `max` to `undefined` or a default, potentially leading to an unbounded connection pool. This can cause resource exhaustion (too many open connections) and crash the application or the database.
      💡 Validate the parsed pool size to ensure it's a positive integer. If invalid, fall back to a default or throw an error. For example, use `Number.isInteger()` and ensure it's greater than 0.

```typescript
const rawPoolSize = process.env.DB_POOL_SIZE;
const parsedPoolSize = rawPoolSize ? parseInt(rawPoolSize, 10) : NaN;
const mainPoolSize = (Number.isInteger(parsedPoolSize) && parsedPoolSize > 0) ? parsedPoolSize : 4;

// Or, for stricter validation:
// if (rawPoolSize && (!Number.isInteger(parsedPoolSize) || parsedPoolSize <= 0)) {
//   throw new Error(`Invalid DB_POOL_SIZE: ${rawPoolSize}. Must be a positive integer.`);
// }
// const mainPoolSize = parsedPoolSize || 4;
```
    - Line 64: [MEDIUM] Magic numbers `10000` (10 seconds) and `120000` (2 minutes) are used directly for `idleTimeoutMillis` and `connectionTimeoutMillis` in both `NeonPool` and `PgPool` configurations. This reduces readability and maintainability, as their meaning is not immediately clear without comments, and changes would require modifying them in multiple places.
      💡 Extract these magic numbers into named constants to improve readability and centralize their definition. Also, the values are duplicated.

```typescript
const IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS = 10000; // 10 seconds
const CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS = 120000; // 2 minutes

// ... inside createDbPool
    const neonPool = new NeonPool({
      // ...
      idleTimeoutMillis: IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS,
      connectionTimeoutMillis: CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS,
    });
// ...
    const pgPool = new PgPool({
      // ...
      idleTimeoutMillis: IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS,
      connectionTimeoutMillis: CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS,
    });
```
    - Line 94: [MEDIUM] Using `as any` (`export const pool = db as any;`) bypasses TypeScript's type checking. While explained as a workaround for legacy code, it indicates technical debt and reduces the type safety and maintainability of the codebase.
      💡 Refactor the legacy code that relies on this `pool` export to directly use the `db` object with its proper type (`DbConnection`). This will eliminate the need for `any` and improve type safety.
    - Line 15: [LOW] The logic for `isNeonDatabase` relies on string inclusion checks (e.g., `.neon.tech`, `supabase.com`). While functional for common cases, this can be brittle and prone to breaking if service URLs change or if other database providers start using similar naming conventions. A more robust detection mechanism might involve parsing the connection string for specific parameters (e.g., `sslmode=require` if universally used by Neon, or `application_name`) or using an explicit environment variable.
      💡 Consider adding an explicit environment variable (e.g., `DB_DRIVER=neon` or `DB_DRIVER=pg`) to determine the database driver. This offers clearer intent and is less prone to breaking from URL changes. Alternatively, if relying on connection strings, look for parameters that uniquely identify Neon connections if available.
    - Line 49: [LOW] The global `neonConfig.webSocketConstructor = ws;` is set inside the `createDbPool` function. While the comment notes it's safe to set multiple times, it's a global configuration that generally only needs to be set once at application startup. Setting it within a factory function that might be called multiple times is redundant and can be misleading.
      💡 Move the `neonConfig.webSocketConstructor = ws;` line to a more appropriate place, such as directly within the initial setup block (e.g., near the `DATABASE_URL` check) where global configurations are typically handled, ensuring it's only executed once.
    - Line 85: [LOW] The default pool size `'4'` is a magic number. While explained in comments, using a named constant improves readability and makes it easier to understand and modify its purpose.
      💡 Extract the default pool size into a named constant.

```typescript
const DEFAULT_DB_POOL_SIZE = 4;
const mainPoolSize = parseInt(process.env.DB_POOL_SIZE || String(DEFAULT_DB_POOL_SIZE), 10);
// ... (and apply validation as suggested for the high-severity bug)
```

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/server/index.ts
   📈 Maintainability: 8/10 - The codebase demonstrates solid security practices, clear structure, and good error handling. While there are a few areas for refactoring to leverage standard libraries more or reduce intrusive patterns, the overall code quality and maintainability are good.
    - Line 90: [MEDIUM] The CORS middleware allows wildcard access (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) for GET/HEAD/OPTIONS requests when no `Origin` header is present, but rejects all other (state-changing) methods. While this aims to protect against CSRF from certain non-browser clients, it can inadvertently block legitimate server-to-server or internal API calls that might not send an Origin header, leading to unexpected 403 Forbidden errors for valid consumers.
      💡 Re-evaluate the need for an `Origin` header for internal or server-to-server communications performing state-changing operations. If these clients are trusted, consider alternative authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, mTLS) for them and bypass the `Origin` check, or explicitly include their expected origins in `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` if they can be configured to send an `Origin` header.
    - Line 208: [LOW] The `dataPruningService` is noted to 'auto-initialize in its constructor'. This pattern can lead to unexpected side effects or make its lifecycle harder to manage and test. If the constructor performs long-running or asynchronous operations, these might not be properly awaited or handled during application startup or shutdown.
      💡 Refactor `dataPruningService` to have an explicit `start()` method that is called after the service is instantiated and imported. This makes the service's initialization explicit and controllable, improving readability and maintainability.

```typescript
// services/data-pruning.ts
class DataPruningService {
    constructor() { /* Avoid side effects here */ }
    async start() {
        console.log("Data pruning service started.");
        // ... initialization logic, start schedules, etc.
    }
    async stop() { /* ... cleanup */ }
}
export const dataPruningService = new DataPruningService();

// index.ts
import("./services/data-pruning").then(({ dataPruningService }) => {
  dataPruningService.start().catch(err => {
    console.error("[DATA_PRUNING] Failed to start:", err);
  });
});
```
    - Line 140: [LOW] The logging middleware uses `JSON.stringify(capturedJsonResponse)` to serialize the entire response body for logging. For API endpoints that return very large JSON responses, this operation can be CPU-intensive and add noticeable overhead on every request, even if the final log line is truncated.
      💡 To reduce performance overhead for large responses, consider optimizing the logging of `capturedJsonResponse`:
1. Log only a subset of relevant fields (e.g., `id`, `status`).
2. Truncate the stringified JSON *before* concatenating it to the log line, reducing the amount of data written to logs, or only stringify if the log level is verbose.
3. Implement conditional stringification based on response size or specific route patterns.
    - Line 30: [LOW] The `safeJsonParser` middleware reimplements significant functionality already provided by `express.json()`, such as content-type checking, body size limiting, and JSON parsing. While it adds custom raw body storage and error messages, leveraging the robust and optimized `express.json()` with its `verify` option could simplify the code and reduce potential custom bugs.
      💡 Replace the custom `safeJsonParser` with `express.json()` and its `verify` option to achieve similar functionality with less custom code and more robustness:

```typescript
// Instead of app.use(safeJsonParser);
app.use(express.json({
  limit: '10mb',
  verify: (req: Request, res: Response, buf: Buffer, encoding: string) => {
    (req as any).rawBody = buf; // Store raw body
  }
}));
```
Custom error handling for malformed JSON can then be managed by Express's standard error middleware if `express.json` throws an error.
    - Line 130: [LOW] The logging middleware overrides `res.json` to capture the response body. This is an intrusive pattern that can be brittle, making the code harder to reason about and potentially causing conflicts if other middleware or libraries also attempt to modify `res.json` or rely on its original behavior. It is generally not an idiomatic way to intercept responses in Express.
      💡 Consider less intrusive methods for capturing response bodies for logging, such as using a dedicated request/response logging library (e.g., `express-winston`, `pino-http`) or by capturing the body in route handlers themselves before sending the response. Alternatively, if `express.json()` is used, the parsed body could be added to `req.body` and potentially processed there (though this is for *request* body, not response).

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/shared/schema.ts
   📈 Maintainability: 8/10: The code defines database schemas clearly and uses Drizzle ORM and Zod effectively. Indexing strategy appears comprehensive for common access patterns. The primary concern is the deliberate lack of many database-level foreign key constraints, which shifts data integrity responsibility to the application layer and requires careful management, but is a conscious design choice for a distributed system.
    - Line 102: [MEDIUM] Many tables that logically reference other entities (e.g., `posts.authorDid` referencing `users.did`, `likes.postUri` referencing `posts.uri`) explicitly do not use database-level foreign key constraints. While this design choice is common in distributed systems like AT Protocol to allow references to external or non-existent entities, it shifts the responsibility for referential integrity entirely to the application layer. This increases the risk of orphaned records or inconsistent data if application logic fails to maintain consistency (e.g., when a referenced entity is deleted or updated locally).
      💡 For entities that *must* exist within the local database and where referential integrity is critical, consider adding database-level foreign key constraints with appropriate `onDelete` actions. For truly external references, ensure robust application-level validation and cleanup logic is in place to handle potential inconsistencies or dangling references gracefully.
    - Line 349: [LOW] The `labelDefinitions.severity` column is defined as a `varchar` with a default value. This allows any string to be stored, potentially leading to inconsistent data if typos or unapproved severity levels are inserted. A `pgEnum` would provide type safety and enforce a predefined set of valid severity values at the database level.
      💡 Define a PostgreSQL enum for severity levels and use it for the `severity` column. Example:
```typescript
import { pgEnum } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

export const severityEnum = pgEnum('severity_level', ['info', 'warn', 'alert', 'none']);

export const labelDefinitions = pgTable("label_definitions", {
  // ... other fields
  severity: severityEnum("severity").default('warn').notNull(),
  // ...
});
```
    - Line 43: [LOW] Multiple `jsonb` columns (e.g., `profileRecord`, `embed`, `contentLabels`, `blockedKeywords`) are defined. While GIN indexes are used for `tsvector` columns, there are no specific indexes for querying or filtering within the `jsonb` data itself (e.g., using JSON path operators). If specific keys or paths within these `jsonb` columns are frequently used in `WHERE` clauses, performance could be suboptimal.
      💡 Analyze common query patterns for `jsonb` fields. If specific nested keys are frequently accessed, consider adding partial GIN indexes or functional indexes on JSON path expressions (e.g., `index('idx_users_profile_name').using('gin', sql`profile_record->>'name'`)`) to optimize these queries.
    - Line 789: [LOW] There is a high degree of repetition in the `createInsertSchema(...).omit({...})` calls. While correct, this boilerplate for omitting auto-generated fields (like `id`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `indexedAt`) can make the schema section lengthy and less concise. Although the omitted fields vary slightly, a common pattern emerges.
      💡 Consider creating a small helper function to reduce repetition for schemas that omit a standard set of fields. For example:
```typescript
const createInsertSchemaWithoutTimestamps = <T extends PgTable>(table: T) => createInsertSchema(table).omit({
  createdAt: true,
  updatedAt: true,
  indexedAt: true,
  id: true // Adjust as needed
});
// Then use:
export const insertUserSchema = createInsertSchemaWithoutTimestamps(users).omit({ id: true }); // example adjusted
```
This would require careful generalization due to varying `omit` fields.

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/client/src/App.tsx
   📈 Maintainability: 9/10 - The code is well-structured, easy to read, and utilizes modern React patterns and libraries effectively. The only minor point is the repetitive routing definitions, which is typical for `wouter` in this scenario.
    - Line 20: [LOW] Multiple `Route` components are defined with different paths (`/`, `/firehose`, `/database`, `/api`, `/lexicons`, `/logs`) but all point to the same `Dashboard` component. This repetition, while functional, can make the router definition verbose and less concise.
      💡 While `wouter` requires explicit `Route` definitions for distinct paths that do not follow a pattern, consider if these paths could be grouped or generated more dynamically if the list grows significantly, or if a different routing approach (e.g., using a wildcard route like `<Route path="/dashboard/:subpath*" component={Dashboard} />` if paths share a common prefix) might offer more conciseness. For the current set of disparate paths, the explicit listing is often the clearest approach.

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/client/src/main.tsx
   📈 Maintainability: 9/10 - The code is extremely concise, readable, and serves its purpose well, with only a minor robustness improvement possible.
    - Line 6: [LOW] The non-null assertion operator (!) is used with `document.getElementById("root")`. If the 'root' element is not found in the HTML, this will result in a runtime error because createRoot expects a non-null HTMLElement.
      💡 Add an explicit null check for the root element to prevent potential runtime errors and improve application robustness.

```tsx
const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
if (rootElement) {
  createRoot(rootElement).render(<App />);
} else {
  console.error("Root element with ID 'root' not found in the document.");
  // Handle the error, e.g., display a fallback UI or throw a more specific error
}
```

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/client/src/lib/api.ts
   📈 Maintainability: 8/10: The code is generally well-structured and follows good practices for API interaction and CSRF handling, though it could benefit from improved type strictness and conditional logging in production.
    - Line 70: [MEDIUM] Extensive use of the `any` type (e.g., `body?: any`, `Promise<any>`, `const error: any`) reduces type safety and makes the code harder to reason about and refactor. While common in some JavaScript contexts, TypeScript aims to provide stronger type guarantees.
      💡 Define specific interfaces or types for `body` and the expected return types of API calls (e.g., `Promise<T>`). This would significantly improve type safety and provide better developer experience.
    - Line 95: [LOW] Magic numbers are used for HTTP status codes (e.g., 403, 401, 204). Using named constants improves readability, maintainability, and makes the code less prone to errors.
      💡 Define constants for HTTP status codes, e.g., `const HTTP_STATUS_FORBIDDEN = 403;`, and use them in the code. This makes the code more self-documenting and easier to update.
    - Line 23: [LOW] The code contains numerous `console.log` and `console.warn` statements. While useful for debugging during development, these should ideally be conditionally enabled or removed in production builds to avoid disclosing potentially sensitive information or cluttering the client's console.
      💡 Implement a logging utility that can be configured to disable or filter logs based on the environment (e.g., `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'`).

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/client/src/lib/queryClient.ts
   📈 Maintainability: 7/10 - The code is generally well-structured and utilizes a modern library effectively, but has minor type safety and readability improvements possible.
    - Line 9: [MEDIUM] The 'queryKey' array elements are joined by '/' to form a URL path. If 'queryKey' contains user-supplied data without proper sanitization, an attacker could potentially inject path traversal sequences (e.g., '../') or other malicious strings, leading to unintended API calls or data access. While API client libraries often handle query parameter encoding, path segments might require explicit validation or encoding.
      💡 Validate or sanitize 'queryKey' elements before joining them, especially if they can originate from user input. Consider using a URL builder utility that correctly handles path segment encoding. Example: Ensure 'queryKey' elements do not contain '/' or '..' if they are meant to be simple path segments.
    - Line 11: [LOW] The 'error' parameter in the catch block is typed as 'any'. This bypasses TypeScript's type checking, making it harder to detect potential issues at compile time and obscures the expected error structure. For network requests, a more specific type like 'AxiosError' (if using Axios) would be beneficial.
      💡 Use a more specific error type. If 'api.get' is an Axios instance, import 'AxiosError' and use `catch (error: AxiosError)`. This allows for better type-checking on 'error.response?.status'.
    - Line 13: [LOW] The type assertion 'null as T' forces 'null' into type 'T'. This can be problematic if 'T' does not actually permit 'null' (i.e., 'T' is not 'T | null'). While React Query can handle undefined for no data, returning 'null' when 'T' isn't nullable could lead to runtime type errors or unexpected behavior in consumers that don't explicitly check for 'null'.
      💡 If 'T' should be nullable in case of a 401, define `getQueryFn`'s return type as `QueryFunction<T | null>`. Alternatively, ensure that `T` is always defined as `SomeType | null` when `on401` is 'returnNull'.
    - Line 26: [LOW] The 'error' parameter in the 'retry' function is typed as 'any'. Similar to the 'getQueryFn' catch block, this reduces type safety and makes it harder to reason about the error structure.
      💡 Use a more specific error type, such as 'AxiosError', if applicable. This would allow for proper type-checking on 'error.response?.status'.
    - Line 25: [LOW] Magic numbers (401, 403, 404) are used directly for HTTP status codes in the 'retry' logic. While common, using named constants for these values improves readability and maintainability.
      💡 Define constants for these HTTP status codes (e.g., `const HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED = 401;`) and use them instead of the raw numbers.

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/client/src/lib/websocket.ts
   📈 Maintainability: 8/10: The code is well-structured, correctly uses React hooks for state and lifecycle management, and handles cleanup effectively, demonstrating good readability and intent, though some minor improvements in configurability and logging practices could be made.
    - Line 28: [LOW] The hook parses incoming SSE data as JSON and passes it directly to the `onMessage` callback. If the `onMessage` callback renders this data directly into the DOM (e.g., using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React) without proper sanitization, it could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the SSE stream can be manipulated by an attacker.
      💡 Consumers of this hook should ensure that any data received through the `onMessage` callback is properly sanitized before being rendered into HTML. It is recommended to add a warning in the hook's JSDoc about the need for consumer-side sanitization. For example, use a library like `DOMPurify` if rendering arbitrary HTML content.
    - Line 15: [LOW] The SSE stream URL `/api/events/stream` is hardcoded within the hook. While acceptable for a highly specific use case, making it configurable (e.g., via a prop or a configuration constant) would significantly increase the hook's reusability and flexibility across different environments or endpoints.
      💡 Pass the SSE URL as an argument to the `useEventStream` hook: `export function useEventStream<T>(sseUrl: string, onMessage: (data: T) => void)`. Alternatively, define it as a named constant in a dedicated configuration file.
    - Line 16: [LOW] Extensive `console.log` and `console.error` statements are present throughout the hook. While useful during development for debugging, these logs can clutter the browser console, expose internal application details, and incur minor performance overhead in production environments.
      💡 Consider conditionally logging based on the environment (e.g., `if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') { console.log(...) }`). For more robust logging, integrate a dedicated logging library or create a custom logger that can be configured for different environments.
    - Line 42: [LOW] The `useWebSocket` export is explicitly marked as deprecated and aliases `useEventStream`. While providing backward compatibility is sometimes necessary, deprecated code adds to the maintenance burden and indicates technical debt if it is not eventually removed.
      💡 Plan for the eventual removal of the deprecated `useWebSocket` alias. Communicate this deprecation clearly to users of the hook, providing a straightforward migration path to `useEventStream` to avoid breaking changes in the future.

📁 /home/doll/PublicAppView/client/src/pages/admin-moderation.tsx
   📈 Maintainability: 6/10 - The code uses modern React and query patterns effectively, but the main component's excessive length and responsibilities significantly hinder maintainability and readability.
    - Line 56: [HIGH] Potential Open Redirect vulnerability. The `window.location.href` is set to `data.authUrl` directly from the API response.
      💡 The backend must strictly validate `authUrl` to ensure it always points to a trusted domain before returning it to the client. On the client-side, consider adding an allow-list check for the domain of `data.authUrl` before redirection, although the primary defense should be server-side.
    - Line 28: [HIGH] The `AdminControlPanel` component is excessively long and has too many responsibilities, encompassing authentication, system status, and two distinct moderation features (apply/search labels).
      💡 Refactor into smaller, more focused sub-components. For example, `AdminLoginPanel`, `SystemStatusPanel`, `ApplyLabelPanel`, `SearchLabelsPanel`, and `ModerationGuide`. This improves readability, maintainability, and testability. For example:
```tsx
// Example refactoring idea
function AdminLoginPanel({ loginHandle, setLoginHandle, handleLogin, isPending }) { /* ... login UI ... */ }
function ApplyLabelPanel({ subjectUri, setSubjectUri, ... }) { /* ... apply label UI ... */ }
// ... and so on

export default function AdminControlPanel() {
  // ... states and hooks ...
  if (!isAuthenticated) return <AdminLoginPanel ... />;
  return (
    <div>
      <SystemStatusPanel ... />
      <ApplyLabelPanel ... />
      <SearchLabelsPanel ... />
      <ModerationGuide />
    </div>
  );
}
```
    - Line 313: [MEDIUM] Potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. User-controlled data (`label.val`, `label.createdAt`, `label.neg`) fetched from the backend is rendered directly into the DOM.
      💡 While these labels are likely managed by administrators, if the backend doesn't sanitize data stored for these labels, an attacker who gains access to label creation could inject malicious scripts. Ensure all user-generated or backend-stored content displayed in the UI is properly sanitized/escaped at the backend before being sent to the client, or use a library like `DOMPurify` on the client if backend control is not feasible.
    - Line 94: [MEDIUM] Magic number `5000` is used for `refetchInterval` without a clear constant name.
      💡 Extract the magic number into a named constant to improve readability and maintainability.
```typescript
const FIREHOSE_METRICS_REFETCH_INTERVAL = 5000;
// ...
refetchInterval: FIREHOSE_METRICS_REFETCH_INTERVAL,
```
    - Line 100: [LOW] Using `metrics as any` bypasses TypeScript's type safety. This makes the code brittle and prone to runtime errors if the `metrics` API response structure changes unexpectedly.
      💡 Define a proper interface for the `metrics` data structure (`FirehoseMetrics` or similar) and use it in `useQuery` and for type assertions to ensure type safety and better maintainability.
```typescript
interface FirehoseMetrics {
  firehoseStatus?: { connected: boolean };
  eventCounts?: { '#commit'?: number; '#identity'?: number; '#account'?: number; };
  errorRate?: number;
}

// ...
const { data: metrics } = useQuery<FirehoseMetrics>({
  queryKey: ["/api/metrics"],
  refetchInterval: 5000,
});

// ...
// No need for 'as any' then
setFirehoseConnected(metrics.firehoseStatus?.connected || false);
setFirehoseStats({
  commits: metrics.eventCounts?.["#commit"] || 0,
  identity: metrics.eventCounts?.["#identity"] || 0,
  account: metrics.eventCounts?.["#account"] || 0,
  errorRate: metrics.errorRate || 0
});
```
    - Line 286: [LOW] Repeated use of `policy?.labels.find(l => l.value === selectedLabel)` for description lookup. While acceptable for small lists, this is an O(N) operation that could become a performance bottleneck if the `policy.labels` array grows very large and triggers frequent re-renders.
      💡 For larger label lists, consider pre-processing `policy.labels` into a `Map` or an object for O(1) lookups. This could be done once after `policy` data is fetched, using `useMemo`.
```typescript
const labelDescriptionMap = useMemo(() => {
  if (!policy?.labels) return new Map();
  return new Map(policy.labels.map(l => [l.value, l.description]));
}, [policy?.labels]);

// ... then in render
{selectedLabel && (
  <div className="p-3 bg-muted rounded-lg">
    <p className="text-sm">
      {labelDescriptionMap.get(selectedLabel)}
    </p>
  </div>
)}
```
