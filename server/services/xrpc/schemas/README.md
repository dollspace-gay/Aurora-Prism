## Usage

Import schemas from the index file:

```typescript
import {
  getTimelineSchema,
  getProfileSchema,
  muteActorSchema,
} from './xrpc/schemas';
```

Or import from specific domain files:

```typescript
import { getTimelineSchema } from './xrpc/schemas/timeline-schemas';
```

## Migration Status

âœ… **Phase 1 Complete**: All schemas extracted from `xrpc-api.ts`
- Total schemas: ~50+ validation schemas
- Organized into 11 domain-specific files
- Centralized export via index.ts

## Benefits

1. **Smaller Files**: Each file ~30-80 lines vs 400+ lines in one file
2. **Clear Organization**: Easy to find schemas by domain
3. **Better Imports**: Import only what you need
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to update and test schemas
5. **Documentation**: Each file has clear purpose and scope
