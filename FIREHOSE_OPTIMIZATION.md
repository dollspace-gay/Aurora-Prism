# Firehose Optimization Available

## ðŸš€ Reduce Memory Usage by 85%

A **Python-based firehose consumer** is now available that eliminates the need for multiple TypeScript workers.

### Quick Comparison

| Metric | TypeScript (Before) | Python + TypeScript (After) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Memory | 64GB (32 workers) | 10GB (1 Python + 4 TS workers) |
| DB Connections | 3,200 | 400 |
| Processes | 32 | 5 |
| Business Logic | Same | **Same (no changes!)** |

### What Changed?

**Only the firehose â†’ Redis ingestion layer** is rewritten in Python.  
**All your TypeScript business logic stays exactly the same.**

```
Before: Firehose â†’ 32 TypeScript workers â†’ Redis â†’ Database
After:  Firehose â†’ 1 Python consumer â†’ Redis â†’ 4 TypeScript workers â†’ Database
```

### How to Use

See **[python-firehose/QUICKSTART.md](./python-firehose/QUICKSTART.md)** for 5-minute setup.

Or deploy now:

```bash
docker-compose up -d python-firehose
```

Your TypeScript workers automatically consume from Redis (no code changes needed).

### Documentation

- **Quick Start**: [python-firehose/QUICKSTART.md](./python-firehose/QUICKSTART.md)
- **Overview**: [python-firehose/SUMMARY.md](./python-firehose/SUMMARY.md)
- **Migration Guide**: [PYTHON_FIREHOSE_MIGRATION.md](./PYTHON_FIREHOSE_MIGRATION.md)
- **Architecture Comparison**: [ARCHITECTURE_COMPARISON.md](./ARCHITECTURE_COMPARISON.md)

### Why This Approach?

Instead of rewriting your entire app in Python (risky, time-consuming), we identified the bottleneck:

- **Problem**: TypeScript firehose connection needs multiple workers due to V8 memory limits
- **Solution**: Python handles firehose ingestion (no memory limits), TypeScript handles processing
- **Result**: Best of both worlds - Python's efficiency + TypeScript's business logic

This is a **surgical optimization**, not a full rewrite!

---

**TL;DR**: Deploy `python-firehose` to reduce memory by 85% with zero business logic changes.
