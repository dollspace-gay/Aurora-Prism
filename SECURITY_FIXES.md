# Security Fixes Applied

## ‚úÖ HIGH Priority Fixes Completed

### 1. OAuth Refresh Token Encryption (server/services/oauth-service.ts)
**Issue**: Refresh tokens were stored in plain text in the database  
**Fix**: Now encrypting refresh tokens using the encryption service before storage (lines 97-99, 107-109)  
**Impact**: Prevents token theft from database compromise

### 2. DID Mismatch Validation (server/services/did-resolver.ts) 
**Issue**: DID document ID mismatch only logged warnings instead of failing
**Fix**: Now throws errors when DID mismatch detected (lines 527-529, 611-613)
**Impact**: Prevents impersonation attacks via DID spoofing

### 3. Firehose Worker Distribution Bug (server/services/firehose.ts)
**Issue**: On reconnect, workerId and totalWorkers were not passed, causing all workers to become worker 0
**Fix**: Now passes this.workerId and this.totalWorkers to connect() on reconnect (line 422)
**Impact**: Maintains proper event distribution across clustered workers

### 4. CORS Array Mutation (server/index.ts)
**Issue**: ALLOWED_ORIGINS array was mutated on every request, causing memory leak
**Fix**: Origins now initialized once at startup using IIFE (lines 92-104)
**Impact**: Prevents memory leaks and performance degradation

### 5. Duplicate WebSocket Handlers (server/routes.ts)
**Issue**: Two wss.on("connection") handlers existed, second one overwrote first
**Fix**: Consolidated into single handler (line 3189)
**Impact**: Ensures all WebSocket functionality works correctly

### 6. Error Logging in Import Scripts
**Issue**: Silent error suppression in import-car.ts and similar scripts
**Fix**: Errors now logged with error counts tracked (e.g., lines 236-239)
**Impact**: Improves debuggability and prevents silent data loss

### 7. Hardcoded PDS Endpoint (server/routes.ts)
**Issue**: com.atproto.server.refreshSession and getSession used hardcoded/default PDS endpoint
**Fix**: Now decodes JWT tokens to extract user DID and resolves to correct PDS endpoint (lines 2443-2493, 2515-2565)
**Impact**: Ensures session operations are routed to user's actual PDS, prevents token leakage

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH Priority Issues Remaining

**Status**: ‚úÖ ALL RESOLVED! No HIGH priority security issues remaining.

## üü° MEDIUM Priority Issues Fixed

### 1. XSS Prevention in Login Page (client/src/pages/login.tsx)
**Issue**: URL parameters and error messages displayed without sanitization
**Fix**: Added sanitizeText() function and applied to all user-facing error messages (lines 12-16, 31, 82)
**Impact**: Prevents XSS attacks via URL parameters and error message injection

### 2. Open Redirect Vulnerability (client/src/pages/login.tsx) 
**Issue**: Redirected to backend-provided authUrl without validation
**Fix**: Now validates URL protocol is HTTPS before redirecting (lines 58-77)
**Impact**: Prevents redirect to malicious phishing sites

### 3. CSS Injection in Charts (client/src/components/ui/chart.tsx)
**Issue**: Chart IDs and color values injected into CSS without sanitization
**Fix**: Added sanitizeCSSValue() and sanitizeCSSIdentifier() functions (lines 70-84)
**Impact**: Prevents CSS injection attacks via malicious chart configurations

### 4. XSS in Log Messages (client/src/components/logs-panel.tsx)
**Issue**: Log messages rendered without sanitization
**Fix**: Added sanitizeLogMessage() function to strip HTML tags and dangerous content (lines 25-33, 187)
**Impact**: Prevents XSS attacks via malicious log injection

### 5. URL Injection in Admin Authorization (server/services/admin-authorization.ts)
**Issue**: Handle parameter not URL-encoded when making external requests
**Fix**: Now uses encodeURIComponent() for handle parameter (line 75)
**Impact**: Prevents URL injection and malformed requests

### 6. User Input in Takedown Reasons (server/services/instance-moderation.ts)
**Issue**: User-provided requestor and details embedded in reason without sanitization
**Fix**: Added sanitization to remove HTML characters and limit length (lines 157-163)
**Impact**: Prevents XSS when takedown reasons are displayed in admin UI

### 7. SSRF Protection in PDS Resolution (server/services/xrpc-api.ts)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Already implemented - uses isUrlSafeToFetch() validation (line 493)
**Impact**: Prevents malicious DIDs from pointing to internal services

### 8. localStorage Token Storage ‚Üí HttpOnly Cookies (client/src/lib/api.ts, client/src/pages/login.tsx, client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx)
**Issue**: Dashboard authentication tokens stored in localStorage, vulnerable to XSS
**Fix**: 
- Removed all localStorage token storage from frontend
- Backend already sets HttpOnly cookie (auth_token) with secure flags
- Updated API client to use cookie-based authentication (credentials: 'include')
- Removed Bearer token Authorization header in favor of cookies
**Impact**: Eliminates XSS-based token theft vector, even if XSS vulnerability is discovered

### 9. Misleading Function Name (server/utils/sanitize.ts, manual-import.ts)
**Issue**: sanitizeObject() function name misleading - only removes null bytes, doesn't prevent XSS/injection
**Fix**: 
- Renamed to removeNullBytesFromObject() with clear documentation
- Added deprecated alias for backward compatibility
- Added security warning in JSDoc about what it does/doesn't do
- Removed duplicate function in manual-import.ts
**Impact**: Prevents future developers from assuming false security guarantees

## üìã Additional Improvements Made

- Added proper TypeScript type safety in critical areas
- Improved error handling consistency across import scripts  
- Enhanced logging for security-relevant operations
- Fixed race conditions in OAuth state management

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Implement proper PDS resolution for session operations** - Extract DID from JWT tokens and resolve to user's actual PDS
2. **Review and strengthen input sanitization** - Audit all user-controlled data paths for proper validation
3. **Complete audit of remaining MEDIUM priority items** from original report
4. **Add integration tests** for security-critical paths

## üìù Notes

- All fixes maintain backward compatibility
- Production deployment should include monitoring for:
  - Failed DID resolution attempts
  - OAuth session encryption/decryption errors
  - Firehose reconnection patterns
  - CORS policy violations

## üéØ Deployment Recommendations

### Pre-Deployment Checks
- [ ] Verify encryption service is properly configured with SESSION_SECRET
- [ ] Test DID resolution with various PDS providers (not just bsky.social)
- [ ] Validate JWT token decoding works with both base64 and base64url encoding
- [ ] Confirm database has encryption service dependencies available

### Monitoring Additions
```
Alert on:
- DID resolution failures (could indicate network issues or malicious DIDs)
- JWT decode failures (could indicate token tampering)
- OAuth session encryption/decryption errors (critical auth failure)
- Firehose reconnection patterns (clustering health check)
```

### Rollback Plan
If issues are detected:
1. All changes are backward compatible except PDS endpoint resolution
2. Can temporarily restore DEFAULT_PDS_ENDPOINT fallback for session operations
3. Database schema unchanged - no migration rollback needed
