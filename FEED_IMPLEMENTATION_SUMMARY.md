# Feed Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of Bluesky-compatible `app.bsky.feed.getAuthorFeed` functionality, bringing the implementation into feature compliance with Bluesky's appview.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **Added `feed_items` table**: Tracks different types of content in feeds (posts, reposts, replies)
- **Added `pinned_post` field to users table**: Supports pinned posts in profiles
- **Proper indexing**: Optimized for feed queries with originator and sort time indexes

### 2. Feed Types Support
Implemented all standard Bluesky feed types:
- `posts_with_replies` (default): All posts, replies, and reposts
- `posts_no_replies`: Only original posts and reposts (no replies)
- `posts_with_media`: Only posts with image or external embeds
- `posts_with_video`: Only posts with video embeds
- `posts_and_author_threads`: Complete self-threads with author's posts

### 3. Advanced Features
- **Pinned Posts**: Support for pinned posts at the top of feeds
- **Repost Tracking**: Distinguishes between original posts and reposts
- **Thread Handling**: Complex logic for `posts_and_author_threads` filter
- **Blocking/Muting**: Sophisticated relationship filtering
- **Self-thread Validation**: Ensures complete thread context

### 4. Architecture Improvements
- **Pipeline Pattern**: Similar to Bluesky's 4-stage pipeline:
  1. Skeleton (data fetching)
  2. Hydration (enriching data)
  3. Filtering (blocks/mutes)
  4. Presentation (final formatting)

- **Hydration System**: Rich context loading for posts, reposts, and relationships
- **Views System**: Clean separation of data and presentation logic

### 5. Error Handling
- **Relationship Validation**: Specific errors for blocked actors
- **Cursor Validation**: Proper pagination cursor handling
- **Comprehensive Error Types**: `BlockedActor`, `BlockedByActor`

## Files Modified/Created

### Schema Changes
- `shared/schema.ts`: Added feed_items table and pinned_post field
- `migrations/add_feed_items_and_pinned_posts.sql`: Database migration

### New Services
- `server/types/feed.ts`: Feed types, enums, and utilities
- `server/services/hydration.ts`: Data hydration system
- `server/services/views.ts`: Feed view rendering

### Updated Services
- `server/storage.ts`: Added feed operations and relationship queries
- `server/services/xrpc-api.ts`: Completely rewritten getAuthorFeed endpoint

## API Changes

### New Parameters
- `filter`: Feed type filter (posts_with_replies, posts_no_replies, etc.)
- `includePins`: Boolean to include pinned posts

### Enhanced Response
- Proper feed item structure with post/repost distinction
- Pinned post handling
- Rich context with viewer relationships
- Proper cursor-based pagination

## Database Queries

### Feed Items Query
```sql
SELECT feed_items.*, posts.*
FROM feed_items
INNER JOIN posts ON posts.uri = feed_items.post_uri
WHERE feed_items.originator_did = ?
  AND feed_items.sort_at < ?
ORDER BY feed_items.sort_at DESC
LIMIT ?
```

### Feed Type Filtering
- **posts_no_replies**: Filters out replies, keeps posts and reposts
- **posts_with_media**: Checks for image/external embeds
- **posts_with_video**: Checks for video embeds
- **posts_and_author_threads**: Complex thread validation

## Performance Optimizations

### Indexing
- `idx_feed_items_originator_sort`: Composite index for feed queries
- `idx_feed_items_type`: Type-based filtering
- `idx_feed_items_post`: Post relationship queries

### Caching
- Hydration system with proper caching
- Relationship state caching
- Feed item hydration caching

## Compatibility

### Bluesky API Compliance
- ✅ All standard feed types supported
- ✅ Proper error responses with correct error names
- ✅ Correct feed item structure
- ✅ Pinned post handling
- ✅ Relationship filtering
- ✅ Cursor-based pagination

### AT Protocol Standards
- ✅ Proper URI handling
- ✅ CID validation
- ✅ DID resolution
- ✅ Record structure compliance

## Testing

### Manual Testing
- Created test script: `test-feed-implementation.js`
- Database migration script ready
- All feed types can be tested

### Validation
- Schema validation with Zod
- Parameter validation
- Error handling validation
- Response structure validation

## Migration Path

1. **Database Migration**: Run `migrations/add_feed_items_and_pinned_posts.sql`
2. **Data Population**: Existing posts and reposts are automatically migrated
3. **API Update**: New endpoint behavior is backward compatible
4. **Testing**: Verify all feed types work correctly

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- List-based blocking/muting
- Advanced thread gating
- Feed generator integration
- Real-time feed updates
- Advanced caching strategies

### Performance Monitoring
- Query performance metrics
- Cache hit rates
- Feed generation times
- Memory usage optimization

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully brings the `getAuthorFeed` endpoint into full feature compliance with Bluesky's appview, providing:

- ✅ Complete feed type support
- ✅ Advanced filtering capabilities
- ✅ Proper relationship handling
- ✅ Pinned post support
- ✅ Thread management
- ✅ Performance optimizations
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ API compatibility

The implementation follows Bluesky's architectural patterns while maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase.
