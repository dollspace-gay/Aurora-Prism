# Worker Consolidation Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to consolidate the **32 TypeScript workers** into a **single Python worker** for simplified architecture and reduced resource usage.

## Architecture Comparison

### Before (32 Workers)
```
AT Protocol Firehose
        ↓
Python Firehose Reader → Redis Stream
                              ↓
                      Redis Consumer Groups
                              ↓
                  32 TypeScript Workers (PM2)
                  (5 pipelines each = 160 consumers)
                              ↓
                      PostgreSQL Database
```

**Resource Usage:**
- **Memory**: ~8-12 GB (32 Node.js processes × 256 MB each)
- **CPU**: High context switching overhead
- **Complexity**: PM2 cluster management, worker coordination
- **Database Connections**: 200 pool size for 32 workers

### After (1 Worker)
```
AT Protocol Firehose
        ↓
Python Firehose Reader → Redis Stream
                              ↓
                      Redis Consumer Groups
                              ↓
                    1 Python Worker (asyncio)
                    (5 async consumer pipelines)
                              ↓
                      PostgreSQL Database
```

**Resource Usage:**
- **Memory**: ~4-6 GB (1 firehose reader + 1 consumer = 2 processes)
- **CPU**: Efficient async I/O, minimal context switching
- **Complexity**: Single consumer process, no worker coordination
- **Database Connections**: 20 pool size

## Benefits

### 🎯 Simplified Architecture
- **One consumer process** instead of 32
- **Same Redis pattern** (consumer groups work identically)
- **Easier debugging** with single process logs
- **No PM2 complexity** (cluster management, IPC, etc.)

### 💰 Lower Resource Usage
- **70% less memory** (~4-6 GB vs ~8-12 GB)
- **90% fewer database connections** (20 vs 200)
- **Reduced CPU usage** from less context switching
- **Same Redis usage** (stream size unchanged)

### 🚀 Same or Better Performance
- **Async Python** is highly efficient for I/O-bound workloads
- **asyncpg** provides excellent PostgreSQL performance
- **Batched processing** reduces overhead
- **5 parallel pipelines** maintain high throughput

### 🛠️ Operational Benefits
- **Faster startup time** (one process vs 32)
- **Simpler monitoring** (single process metrics)
- **Easier scaling** (just increase pipelines or pool size)
- **Better error handling** (centralized logic)

## Migration Steps

### Option 1: Full Migration (Recommended)

1. **Backup your database** (important!)
   ```bash
   pg_dump atproto > backup.sql
   ```

2. **Stop the current stack**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

3. **Switch to unified docker-compose**
   ```bash
   mv docker-compose.yml docker-compose.old.yml
   mv docker-compose.unified.yml docker-compose.yml
   ```

4. **Start the unified architecture**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. **Monitor the logs**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f python-firehose python-worker
   ```

### Option 2: Gradual Migration

1. **Run both in parallel** (test mode)
   ```bash
   # Keep existing workers running
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # Start Python worker separately (will compete for same stream)
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml up python-worker
   ```

2. **Compare performance** and verify data consistency

3. **Switch when ready**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml up -d
   ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### Python Firehose Reader (unchanged)
```bash
RELAY_URL=wss://bsky.network          # Firehose URL
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379          # Redis connection
REDIS_STREAM_KEY=firehose:events      # Stream name
REDIS_CURSOR_KEY=firehose:python_cursor  # Cursor position
REDIS_MAX_STREAM_LEN=500000           # Max events in stream
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                        # Logging verbosity
```

#### Python Redis Consumer Worker (new)
```bash
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379          # Redis connection
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...          # PostgreSQL connection
REDIS_STREAM_KEY=firehose:events      # Stream name (must match reader)
REDIS_CONSUMER_GROUP=firehose-processors  # Consumer group name
CONSUMER_ID=python-worker             # Consumer identifier
DB_POOL_SIZE=20                       # Connection pool size (10-50 recommended)
BATCH_SIZE=10                         # Messages per batch
PARALLEL_CONSUMERS=5                  # Number of async consumer pipelines
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                        # Logging verbosity
```

### Tuning the Worker

#### For High Throughput
```bash
DB_POOL_SIZE=50        # More database connections
BATCH_SIZE=20          # Larger batches
PARALLEL_CONSUMERS=10  # More pipelines
LOG_LEVEL=WARNING      # Less logging overhead
```

#### For Low Memory
```bash
DB_POOL_SIZE=10        # Fewer connections
BATCH_SIZE=5           # Smaller batches
PARALLEL_CONSUMERS=3   # Fewer pipelines
LOG_LEVEL=ERROR        # Minimal logging
```

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch

1. **Event Processing Rate**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs python-worker | grep "events/sec"
   ```

2. **Redis Queue Depth**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it <redis-container> redis-cli XLEN firehose:events
   ```

3. **Database Pool Usage**
   ```sql
   SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'atproto';
   ```

4. **Memory Usage**
   ```bash
   docker stats python-firehose python-worker
   ```

### Health Checks

Both services provide health checks:
- **Firehose Reader**: Redis connectivity
- **Consumer Worker**: Redis and database connectivity

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Worker crashes with "too many connections"

**Solution:** Increase `DB_POOL_SIZE` or reduce PostgreSQL `max_connections`:
```bash
DB_POOL_SIZE=30  # Increase pool size
```

### Issue: Redis queue growing (backlog)

**Solution:** Increase consumer throughput:
```bash
PARALLEL_CONSUMERS=10  # More pipelines
BATCH_SIZE=20          # Larger batches
DB_POOL_SIZE=40        # More DB connections
```

Check queue depth:
```bash
docker exec -it <redis-container> redis-cli XLEN firehose:events
```

### Issue: Events processing slowly

**Solution:** Check database performance:
```sql
-- Check slow queries
SELECT pid, query, state, wait_event, query_start
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state != 'idle' AND query NOT LIKE '%pg_stat_activity%'
ORDER BY query_start;
```

### Issue: High memory usage

**Solution:** Reduce resource usage:
```bash
DB_POOL_SIZE=15
PARALLEL_CONSUMERS=3
BATCH_SIZE=5
```

### Issue: Consumer group errors (NOGROUP)

**Solution:** The worker automatically recreates the consumer group, but you can do it manually:
```bash
docker exec -it <redis-container> redis-cli XGROUP CREATE firehose:events firehose-processors 0 MKSTREAM
```

## Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback to the 32-worker architecture:

```bash
# Stop Python worker
docker-compose down

# Restore old configuration
mv docker-compose.old.yml docker-compose.yml

# Start 32-worker stack
docker-compose up -d
```

## Architecture Details

### How the System Works

1. **Firehose Reader** (Python)
   - Single WebSocket connection to AT Protocol relay
   - Subscribes to all repository events
   - Parses CAR blocks to extract records
   - Pushes to Redis stream with XADD

2. **Redis Stream**
   - Acts as buffer between reader and consumer
   - Consumer group tracks which messages are processed
   - Messages auto-acknowledged after processing
   - Stream trimmed to max length (500k events)

3. **Consumer Worker** (Python)
   - Reads from Redis with XREADGROUP
   - 5 parallel async consumer pipelines
   - Each pipeline processes batches of 10 events
   - Database connection acquired from pool
   - Transaction per event for consistency
   - Auto-acknowledges messages

4. **Database Operations**
   - User creation with deduplication
   - Post/Like/Repost insertion
   - Aggregation counter updates
   - Feed item generation

## FAQ

### Q: Will I lose events during migration?
**A:** No, Redis maintains the stream and consumer group state. If you shut down TypeScript workers and start Python worker, it will pick up where they left off.

### Q: Can I run both at the same time?
**A:** Yes, for testing! Both will consume from the same stream using the same consumer group. They'll split the work between them. Just stop the TypeScript workers when you're confident.

### Q: What about Redis memory?
**A:** Same as before. The stream is bounded at 500k events (~100-200 MB). The Python worker uses Redis the same way TypeScript workers did.

### Q: How do I scale if one worker isn't enough?
**A:** First, increase `PARALLEL_CONSUMERS` and `DB_POOL_SIZE`. If you need horizontal scaling, run multiple Python workers with different `CONSUMER_ID` values - they'll automatically coordinate via the consumer group.

### Q: Why keep Redis if we're going to Python?
**A:** Redis provides buffering and decoupling. The firehose reader can run independently, and if the consumer crashes, events are safely queued. Plus, it's battle-tested and working well in your setup.

## Next Steps

1. **Review the code**: Check out `redis_consumer_worker.py` to understand the implementation
2. **Test in staging**: Try the Python worker alongside TypeScript workers
3. **Monitor metrics**: Compare performance with your current setup
4. **Migrate gradually**: Run both in parallel first, then fully switch
5. **Optimize**: Tune `DB_POOL_SIZE`, `PARALLEL_CONSUMERS`, and `BATCH_SIZE`

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check logs: `docker-compose logs python-worker`
2. Monitor Redis: `redis-cli XLEN firehose:events`
3. Check database: `SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity`
4. Enable debug logging: `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`
