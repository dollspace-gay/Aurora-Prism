# A script to authenticate with Bluesky and fetch the user's timeline.
# This version automatically discovers the user's PDS.
#
# USAGE:
#   ./fetch_timeline.sh your-handle.bsky.social your-app-password
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
#   - curl: For making HTTP requests.
#   - jq: For parsing JSON responses. (Install with: sudo apt-get install jq / brew install jq)

set -e # Exit immediately if any command fails

# --- CONFIGURATION ---
# The AppView to fetch the timeline from.
# Set this to your custom AppView for testing or leave as the official one.
