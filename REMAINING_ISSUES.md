## 🟡 MEDIUM Priority (Estimated ~177 remaining from original 186)

### 1. **setInterval Without Cleanup**
**Location**: Multiple files (21 instances across 14 files)  
**Issue**: `setInterval` used instead of recursive `setTimeout`, can cause overlapping executions  
**Files Affected**:
- `server/routes.ts` (6 instances)
- `server/services/firehose.ts` (2 instances)
- `server/services/event-processor.ts` (2 instances)
- And 11 others

**Risk**: 
- Memory leaks if intervals not properly cleared
- Overlapping executions if task takes longer than interval
- Potential DoS if intervals accumulate

**Fix Required**: Review each usage, replace with recursive `setTimeout` where appropriate  
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Effort**: Medium (requires case-by-case review)  
**Priority**: Medium

### 3. **Array.shift() Performance Issues**
**Location**: 4 files use `.shift()` which is O(n)  
**Files Affected**:
- `server/services/firehose.ts`
- `server/services/did-resolver.ts`
- `server/services/lexicon-validator.ts`
- `server/services/backfill.ts`

**Risk**: Performance degradation with large queues  
**Fix Required**: Replace with index-based access or use queue data structure  
**Severity**: MEDIUM (performance, not security)  
**Effort**: Low  
**Priority**: Low-Medium

### 4. **fs.existsSync Usage**
**Location**: 3 files  
**Issue**: Using sync file operations in async context  
**Files Affected**:
- `server/vite.ts`
- `osprey-bridge/firehose-to-kafka/src/adapters/firehose-adapter.ts`
- `server/services/appview-jwt.ts`

**Risk**: Blocks event loop, impacts performance  
**Fix Required**: Replace with async try/catch pattern  
**Severity**: MEDIUM (performance)  
**Effort**: Low  
**Priority**: Low

### 4. **Other MEDIUM Priority Items** (from original report)
The original audit identified 186 MEDIUM severity issues. After fixing 9, approximately **177 remain**. These likely include:

- Input validation edge cases
- Error message information disclosure
- Timing attack vulnerabilities
- Rate limiting gaps
- Logging sensitive data
- Insufficient monitoring/alerting
- API endpoint enumeration
- CORS configuration edge cases
- Cookie security flags
- HTTP security headers
- Content Security Policy gaps
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Code complexity/maintainability issues

**Recommended**: Re-run the original AI analyzer to get updated list of remaining MEDIUM issues

## 🟢 LOW Priority (Not assessed)

The original report did not enumerate LOW priority issues. These would typically include:

- Code style inconsistencies
- Minor performance optimizations
- Documentation improvements
- Non-security code smells
- Deprecated API usage
- Non-critical type safety improvements

## 📊 Issue Summary

| Priority | Fixed | Remaining | Total | % Complete |
|----------|-------|-----------|-------|------------|
| HIGH | 8 | 0 | 8 | **100%** ✅ |
| MEDIUM | 9 | ~177 | ~186 | 4.8% |
| LOW | 0 | Unknown | Unknown | - |
| **TOTAL** | **17** | **~177** | **~194** | **~9%** |
