# CAR File Import Profile Display Fix

## Problem
After importing a CAR file, several validation errors were occurring in the client:
1. `embed/external/thumb must be a uri` - External link thumbnails with invalid/empty CIDs
2. `embed/record/author/avatar must be a uri` - Avatar fields with empty strings or null values
3. `displayName must be a string` - displayName fields that were null or non-string values

These errors prevented profiles from showing:
- Followers not displaying
- Media tab not working
- Likes not showing up

## Root Cause
When importing CAR files, the system was storing embed data and profile information without proper validation or normalization:

1. **Embed Data**: External link thumbnails and image references with invalid/missing blob CIDs were stored as-is in the database
2. **Profile Data**: Avatar and displayName fields were not being validated before serialization
3. **Serialization**: The API was returning these invalid values directly to the client, causing AT Protocol validation errors

## Solution

### 1. Embed Normalization During Import (`event-processor.ts`)
Added `normalizeEmbed()` function that:
- Removes external embed thumbnails with invalid/missing CIDs
- Filters out images with invalid blob references
- Converts `recordWithMedia` to plain `record` embeds if media is invalid
- Removes video thumbnails with invalid CIDs

This normalization happens **before** storing posts in the database, ensuring only valid embed data is persisted.

### 2. Avatar URI Validation (`embed-resolver.ts`)
Updated embedded record author views to:
- Only include `avatar` field when a valid URI can be generated
- Ensure `displayName` is always a string (fallback to handle)
- Use `'handle.invalid'` as fallback for missing handles (matches Bluesky's approach)

### 3. Profile Field Validation (`xrpc-api.ts`, `views.ts`)
Updated all profile serialization points to:
- Ensure `displayName` is always a string (never null/undefined)
- Fallback to `handle` when `displayName` is missing or invalid
- Only include `avatar` field when it's a valid URI
- Apply same fixes to reposts, pins, and other profile displays

### 4. Feed Generator Validation (`xrpc-api.ts`)
Updated feed generator serialization to:
- Use `'Unnamed Feed'` as fallback for missing displayName

## Files Modified
1. `/workspace/server/services/event-processor.ts`
   - Added `normalizeEmbed()` function
   - Apply normalization during post creation

2. `/workspace/server/services/hydration/embed-resolver.ts`
   - Fixed author view construction for embedded records
   - Ensured displayName is always a string
   - Only include avatar when valid URI available

3. `/workspace/server/services/xrpc-api.ts`
   - Fixed displayName handling in post serialization (both enhanced and legacy paths)
   - Fixed displayName handling in repost reasons
   - Fixed displayName handling in feed generators

4. `/workspace/server/services/views.ts`
   - Fixed displayName handling in pin reasons
   - Fixed displayName handling in repost reasons

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Import a CAR file with posts containing external links/embeds
2. Check that the profile page displays correctly
3. Verify that followers, media tab, and likes all work
4. Check browser console - should no longer see validation errors about URIs or displayName

## AT Protocol Compliance
These changes ensure full compliance with AT Protocol validation requirements:
- `avatar` fields are proper URI strings (format: `/avatar/plain/{did}/{cid}@jpeg`) or omitted
- `thumb` fields in embeds are proper URI strings or omitted
- `displayName` fields are always strings (never null/undefined)
- `handle` fields always have a fallback to `'handle.invalid'` when missing
